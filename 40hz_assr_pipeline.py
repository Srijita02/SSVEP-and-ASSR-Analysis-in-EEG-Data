# 40 Hz Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR) EEG Analysis Pipeline
# Sampling frequency: 2000 Hz throughout
# This script processes Curry .dat EEG recordings to:
# - Validate and load subject data
# - Visualize EEG time series from selected channels
# - Compute power spectral density (PSD) across channels
# - Inject synthetic 40 Hz sine signals for evaluation
# - Calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) around 40 Hz
# - Perform statistical tests to assess SNR significance

# Cleaned and consolidated for 40 Hz ASSR analysis
